Problem Statement: There are 4 locations (labeled by different letters), and our job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off at another. We receive +20 points for a successful drop-off and lose 1 point for every time-step it takes. There is also a 10 points penalty for illegal pick-up and drop-off actions.


1. Design a self driving cab (using above-mentioned parameters) applying "Taxi-v3" model from AI-gym
2. Turn your code into a module of functions that can use multiple environments
3. Tune alpha, gamma, and/or epsilon using a decay over episodes
4. Implement a grid search to discover the best hyperparameters

Note:
* The code can be executed using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
* The necessary Python libraries need to be installed first.

    * Juypter Notebook Renderers
    * Pylance
    * Pylint
    * Python
* Google Colab

*The code was developed using the Jupyter Notebook.*
